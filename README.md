# Pacman
This plays a simplified version of the pacman game, but is still very fun

# Usage
- Either run the executable jar
- or... compile Pacman.java
- run Pacman.java (java Pacman)
- Arrow Keys to move
- If the audio is off, click 'c'
- For new game, click 'r'
- SHHHHHH (Top Secret): For invinsability, win a level, and then create a new game while it's doing the victory spin
